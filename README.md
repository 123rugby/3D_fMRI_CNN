The objective is to improve classification accuracy in schizophrenia and other cognitive disorders using fMRI and 3D recurrent ConvNet. This will be done by refining to the underlying algorithms, converting fMRI data into split 3-dimensional movies, identifying and increasing parallelism in existing code, and extending the single machine code to run on GPU HPCs
